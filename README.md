**`Computer Engineering Undergrad (Full-Stack/Embedded)`**

I'm a 2B Computer Engineering undergrad at the University of Waterloo.
My projects and internship experience are all related to software development, although I am also interested in hardware. 

My projects were developed completely independently or for school projects.
